## Fork changes

This fork optimizes the widget for single-line Windows 11 taskbars:

| Dark mode | Light mode |
|-----------|------------|
| ![Dark](.github/screenshot-dark.png) | ![Light](.github/screenshot-light.png) |

Changes from upstream:

- **Compact layout** — Widget height reduced from 46px to 36px to fit single-line taskbars
- **Better font** — Cascadia Mono at 11pt (medium weight) for improved small-size readability
- **System text color** — White in dark mode, near-black in light mode, matching the Windows clock
- **Right-aligned values** — Percentages and countdowns align consistently across rows
- **Detailed countdown** — Shows hours+minutes (`3h12`) and days+hours (`1d11`) instead of rounded values
- **Improved spacing** — More breathing room around the separator, vertically centered rows

## What it does

Embeds directly into the Windows taskbar and shows two progress bars:

- **5h** — Session usage (5-hour rolling window)
- **7d** — Weekly usage (7-day rolling window)

Each bar shows the current utilization percentage and a countdown until the rate limit resets.

## How it works

1. Reads your Claude OAuth token from `~/.claude/.credentials.json` (automatically refreshes expired tokens via the Claude CLI)
2. Queries the dedicated Anthropic OAuth usage endpoint (`/api/oauth/usage`) for utilization data
3. Falls back to the Messages API with rate limit header parsing (`anthropic-ratelimit-unified-*`) if the usage endpoint is unavailable
4. Renders the widget using Win32 GDI, embedded as a child window of the taskbar
5. Polls every 15 minutes by default (adjustable via context menu) and updates countdown timers between polls

The widget automatically detects dark/light mode from Windows system settings. You can drag the left divider to reposition the widget along the taskbar. Settings (position and poll frequency) are persisted to `%APPDATA%\ClaudeCodeUsageMonitor\settings.json`.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/) (MSVC target)
- An active Claude Pro/Team subscription with OAuth credentials stored by [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)

## Building

```bash
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be at `target/release/claude-code-usage-monitor.exe`.

## Usage

Run the executable — the widget appears in your taskbar.

- **Drag** the left divider to reposition the widget along the taskbar
- **Right-click** for a context menu with **Refresh**, **Update Frequency**, **Settings** (Start with Windows, Reset Position), and **Exit**
